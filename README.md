# Guess-the-Number-Game
The game is the CLI version of the guess the number game written in python. 

# Rules

The game rules are really simple, you need to guess the number generated by the python random number generator. And if you guess the number correctly you win or you have to guess the number again again to win.

# Mechanics

The mechancs of the game is very simple, I have created a list consisting of 10 numbers and then a user gives a give
which is then being verified by the verfication function. Then the user-input number is being verified and checked whether it is equal to the random number generated by
python. If yes then the game is over and asks if you want to retry or quit the game. And if the number isn't the exact as the generated number then the re-match 
function gets activated which gives hints to the player to guess the number. And if the guess gets the correct you win the game and the same retry loop appears again.
